I'll analyze what would be needed to add advertisements at the bottom of all views based on user authentication and premium status. Let me review the necessary files to understand the structure and authentication flow without implementing the changes.

Ran tool
Let's try searching for authentication-related terms:

Ran tool
Let me look for the layout or app structure to understand where we would need to add advertisements:

Read file: app/_layout.tsx
Let me also look at the authentication service:

Read file: app/services/auth/authService.ts
Let me also check the context for authentication:

Read file: app/context/index.ts

Read file: app/context/authContext.tsx
Let me also look for any premium-related code to understand the current premium status implementation:

Ran tool
Based on my analysis, here's what would be needed to implement advertisements at the bottom of all views for non-logged-in users or users without premium status:

## Key Components and Requirements

1. **Authentication State Management**
   - The app uses an `AuthContext` with `isAuthenticated` state that indicates if a user is logged in
   - `useAuth` hook can be used to access this state in components
   - `authService.ts` handles authentication operations with a remote server

2. **Premium Status Implementation (Required but Not Yet Implemented)**
   - Need to add premium status tracking to the user model and authentication context
   - `AuthApi` would need endpoints to check premium status
   - Premium status should be checked both at login and app startup

3. **Global Advertisement Component**
   - Create a new `Advertisement` component to be displayed at the bottom of screens
   - This component should fetch and display actual ad content
   - Include potential tracking and click-through handling

4. **Layout Structure Modification**
   - Modify `app/_layout.tsx` to include the advertisement component conditionally
   - All screens inherit from this layout, making it ideal for global elements

## Implementation Plan (Not to be Implemented Yet)

1. **Add Premium Status Field**
   - Update the user model/type to include a premium status flag
   - Add premium status to the authentication context state
   - Update auth-related API calls to fetch premium status

2. **Create Advertisement Component**
   ```tsx
   // app/components/Advertisement.tsx
   import React from 'react';
   import { View, Text, StyleSheet, TouchableOpacity, Image } from 'react-native';
   import { useAuth } from '../context/authContext';

   export const Advertisement = () => {
     const { isAuthenticated, isPremium } = useAuth();
     
     // Don't show ads for premium or authenticated users
     if (isAuthenticated && isPremium) {
       return null;
     }
     
     return (
       <View style={styles.adContainer}>
         {/* Advertisement content would go here */}
         <Text style={styles.adText}>Advertisement</Text>
       </View>
     );
   };

   const styles = StyleSheet.create({
     adContainer: {
       height: 60,
       backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
       justifyContent: 'center',
       alignItems: 'center',
       borderTopWidth: 1,
       borderTopColor: '#ddd',
     },
     adText: {
       fontSize: 14,
       color: '#666',
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Modify Root Layout**
   - Update `app/_layout.tsx` to include the Advertisement component at the bottom:
   ```tsx
   // Inside the RootLayout component
   return (
     <>
       <AuthProvider>
         <ResetFiltersContext.Provider value={...}>
           <Stack screenOptions={...} />
           <Advertisement /> {/* Add this line */}
         </ResetFiltersContext.Provider>
       </AuthProvider>
     </>
   );
   ```

4. **Update AuthContext API**
   - Update AuthContext to include premium status:
   ```tsx
   interface AuthContextType {
     // Existing fields
     active_user: string | null;
     accessToken: string | null;
     isAuthenticated: boolean;
     
     // Add premium status
     isPremium: boolean;
     
     // Existing methods
     login: (username: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
     // ...
   }
   ```

5. **Add Premium Status Check**
   - Update the login method and app initialization to check premium status:
   ```tsx
   const login = async (username: string, password: string) => {
     try {
       // Existing login code
       
       // Add premium status check
       const userDetails = await AuthApi.getUserDetails(response.access);
       setPremiumStatus(userDetails.isPremium);
       
       // Rest of login code
     } catch (error) {
       // Error handling
     }
   };
   ```

## Considerations

1. **Performance Impact**
   - Ads can impact app performance, especially if they're loading images or videos
   - Consider lazy loading ads for smoother app experience

2. **User Experience**
   - Ads should not interfere with main app functionality
   - Consider sticky bottom ads instead of intrusive interstitials 

3. **Ad Networks**
   - You'll need to integrate with an ad network like AdMob, Facebook Audience Network, etc.
   - Each has its own SDK and implementation requirements

4. **Premium Upgrade Path**
   - Provide a clear path for users to upgrade to premium
   - Add a "Remove Ads" button in the ad component itself

5. **Ad Content Regulation**
   - Ensure ads comply with platform guidelines and legal requirements
   - Implement content filtering appropriate for your app's audience

This implementation plan provides a high-level overview of what would be needed to add advertisement functionality to your application based on user authentication and premium status.
